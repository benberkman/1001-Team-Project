# Modeling Portuguese Wine Quality

Term project for NYU DS-GA 1001: Introduction to Data Science.

Abstract: Wine sales have dramatically increased during the coronavirus pandemic. According to the Washington Post, Americans purchased nearly 30 percent more wine in June 2020 than in March 2020. Given the increased demand, quick and accurate classification of a wineâ€™s quality is important in order to ensure a positive consumer experience and fair price at market. This paper studies if the physicochemical properties of wine can sufficiently predict its quality through supervised learning approaches. This has the potential to aid wine makers (oenologists), evaluators, and consumers. We show that a high-performing random forest algorithm is able make these classifications, and we discuss its business implications and deployment potential.
